The firm started its journey & years ago on September of 2014.

### •	Founder’s journey: 
Before founding Wealthsimple, Michael Katchen worked for a Silicon Valley based startup company called 1000Memories. Later on that company got acquired by Ancestry.com in 2012. Katchen later started to develop spreadsheets that contained tips on helping his fellow colleagues and ex colleagues about setting up investment portfolios. Needless to say such field of work fuelled his mind to generate a much more developed idea on investment and how it could be made simple and easy not for only working professionals but also the millennial. Finally in 2014, he launched his own startup, Wealthsimple.

## Business Activities:
### The Focus of Wealthsimple and Problems they are trying to solve

Wealthsimple is mainly focused on expanding. Both their services and consumer base. Started as an investment portfolio, it has now reached almost every fintech fields. Robo Advising, Wealth Management, Personal Finance and online banking, trading and Cryptocurrency, they’ve already covered the vast field by a lot. Their idea is to grow by weaving innovation into the fabric of their company, no matter what they are doing. The problem they picked up was the sense of hesitation when it comes to investing. Now what stops a person from getting into the investing game is the heavy paperworks, research and the time consumed in the whole process. Needless to say that all the problems are obviously followed by the costing factor. A person with a budget of 100-200 dollars to invest wouldn’t have thought that it is possible to invest and get a viable result from it. Wealthsimple identified this very problem, and made investing simple, easy and accessible to everyone, regardless of age or networth.

### Target Customers
The CEO of the company, Michael Katchen has been investing money from a young age. Since he gained investment experience from early on in his life, his friends always turned to him for advice. Katchen held on to this idea that people surely wants to invest, but whats lacking is the system that enables and makes it easy for them to invest. Traditional investment companies typically target a demographic of people aged 45 or above, but Katchen wanted to bring people in a lot earlier. He believes due to the process of investment being complicated, long and put off by paperwork millennials ends up losing their interest. Today, wealthsimple’s 85% of clients are millennials.

### Competitive Advantage:
Wealthsimple offers not only one type of FinTech service, rather it is flourishing over various FinTech domain. That gives them an upper hand in not only Canada but much more desirable around the world. Sadly it is not accessible around the globe yet, but speculations are there to go global. But having a look at the market they are currently at, there’s no bigger player than them. Coinbase could be a notable example of their competition but even if we consider them being a better platform for  trading cryptocurrency, Wealthsimple is way ahead of Coinbase with all of the other services they offer. Having said that, Coinbase, although being popular worldwide and offering trades of more than 40 cryptocurrency, is costwise not the better option when being compared to Wealthsimple. Wealthsimple’s transaction fees are below 1%. For its basic customers (First $99,999) the fees are 0.5%. For customers spending $100,000 or above, the fees are 0.4%. Where as coinbase the spending fees are 1.2% and trading fees can range between 0.99-3.99%. Moreover Coinbase’s withdrawal system lacks direct deposit. A customer first has to link their PayPal account, make the withdrawal into the paypal account and finally if someone wants it to their bank they have to withdraw form their paypal to their linked banks. Now there comes a double spending factor to multiple platforms. First Coinbase would charge a withdrawal fee which is mentioned above. Second the paypal withdrawal fee. A bit of a hassle and money lost during the process. Wealthsimple however, does support direct withdrawal to your banks.
### Technologies Used:
Wealthsimple uses 29 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics and jQuery. It is actively using 63 technologies for its website according to BuiltWith. These include Viewport Meta, iPhone/Mobile compatible, and Google Font API.
## Landscape:
### Financial Industry Domains:
•	Investment

•	Wealth management

•	Cryptocurrency

•	Robo-Advisor

•	Payments

•	Capital Investment

### Major Trends and innovations over the last 5-10 years:
Wealthsimple has its focus on multiple domains, but whats been common in all of those fields is that all of them are driven by what their current customer base are doing and wanting, satisfying their needs in order to attract more customers like them. For example we can take the fact through what sort of device they are logging into their accounts more, which for most case has been mobile phones. Again, most of the transactions are made on services that provides lower fees than the traditional methods. The quicker and easier the UI gets, the more the customers are getting comfortable using the app and thus the app usage time statistically are rising. 
## Results:
The company which started its jouney with just over a thousand clients in April of 2015, today serves 1.5 million regular active clients. All of them actively investing or have invested in a long term savings account. It continues to grow every year at an astonishing rate with the introduction to new FinTech domains, each addition attracts more customers, each with different interest of how to utilize their accounts.
### Performance compared to it's competitors
In Canada, Wealthsimple is so far the biggest FinTech startup. But it competes globally. Although the competitors are putting on a lot of effort, and some of them might even be better in their respective domains, but Wealthsimple offers something that no other competitors can, a package of all domains in one account. Robinhood and Coinbase are notable competitors but even they are no where near wealthsimple when it comes to offering all services under a single account. Maybe in the near future some app might show up and go global to extend its reach to everybody around earth before wealthsimple does, but according to a recent statement made by the CEO, Wealthsimple is ready to take on more clients and its platform can handle more traffic on a regular basis. Who knows this might point to the company being available in various region soon enough.  
## Recommendations
Wealthsimple offers its services to customers residing only in Canada, UK and USA. Being such a potential platform in such high demand and in trend domains,  the company surely should think of expanding its borders beyond the West. The company should introduce after hour trading as well. If an order is placed after the market is closed, it will be filled the next trading day whereas other platforms can trade 1-2 hours after the closing period. It also does not offer shorting individual stocks like the big banks, making them significantly fall behind the traditional banking which they targets to replace, unless they figures out a way to provide all the services that a bank could provide, their target of replacing a centralized banking system is not happening and that’s the reality of the situation. The company should also try to cut down their management expense ratio (MER) like some of its competitors. It should also focus on cutting down the deposit time. Depositing a fund from ones wealthsimple account to an external bank could take upto three days. They can consider providing all of its clients to their VISA debit card so that all of their available funds could be transferred to that card and be open to use at any merchant that takes VISA as a method of payment. The app delay in their Wealthsimple Trade app should be taken care of as soon as possible. Sometimes the delay could rise upto 15minutes or more. Which means if a client is placing a stock purchase order seeing the app, the company submits the order to the real time market, which might have changed in that 15minutes delay period. Meaning the customer will submit an order at one market price but might receive the stock at a different price point which at times could be very frustrating and result in big loss.
